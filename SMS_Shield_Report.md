# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Background of the Project

In the digital age, mobile communication has become an integral part of our daily lives, with Short Message Service (SMS) remaining one of the most widely used communication methods. However, this widespread adoption has made SMS a prime target for cybercriminals who employ sophisticated phishing techniques to deceive users and steal sensitive information.

SMS phishing, also known as "smishing," involves sending fraudulent text messages that appear to come from legitimate sources such as banks, government agencies, or popular services. These messages typically contain urgent requests, fake offers, or threats designed to manipulate recipients into providing personal information, clicking malicious links, or downloading harmful applications.

The prevalence of SMS phishing attacks has increased dramatically in recent years. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), SMS-based fraud complaints increased by 328% between 2019 and 2020, with losses exceeding $86 million in 2020 alone. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this trend as cybercriminals exploited public health concerns and economic uncertainty.

Traditional security measures such as spam filters and basic keyword detection have proven insufficient against modern SMS phishing attacks. Attackers continuously evolve their techniques, using social engineering tactics, psychological manipulation, and sophisticated language patterns to bypass conventional detection methods.

This project addresses the critical need for advanced SMS phishing detection by developing a comprehensive web-based system that leverages machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to identify and analyze potential threats in real-time.

## 1.2 Statement of the Problem

The current landscape of SMS security faces several significant challenges:

1. **Sophisticated Attack Techniques**: Modern SMS phishing attacks employ advanced social engineering tactics, psychological manipulation, and sophisticated language patterns that traditional detection methods cannot effectively identify.

2. **Limited Detection Capabilities**: Existing SMS security solutions rely primarily on basic keyword filtering and blacklist approaches, which are easily circumvented by attackers using creative language and legitimate-looking content.

3. **High False Positive Rates**: Current detection systems often generate false alarms, leading to user fatigue and reduced trust in security warnings.

4. **Lack of Real-time Analysis**: Most existing solutions lack the capability to provide immediate, detailed analysis of SMS content with explanations of potential threats.

5. **Limited User Education**: Users often lack the knowledge and tools to understand why certain messages are flagged as suspicious, reducing the effectiveness of security measures.

6. **Mobile Platform Limitations**: Mobile devices have limited processing capabilities for running sophisticated security algorithms, making real-time analysis challenging.

7. **Evolving Threat Landscape**: Attackers continuously adapt their techniques, making static detection rules obsolete quickly.

# CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Review of Related Works

### 2.1.1 Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

The application of machine learning in cybersecurity has evolved significantly over the past decade. Zhang et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive survey of machine learning techniques in cybersecurity, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble learning approaches in threat detection. Their research demonstrated that combining multiple algorithms can improve detection accuracy by 15-25% compared to single-model approaches.

Kumar and Patel (2021) explored the use of deep learning for phishing detection, specifically focusing on LSTM networks for sequence analysis. Their study achieved 92.3% accuracy in detecting phishing attempts using natural language processing techniques. However, their work was limited to email-based phishing and did not address SMS-specific challenges.

### 2.1.2 SMS Security Research

Recent studies have highlighted the growing threat of SMS-based attacks. According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) 2022 report, SMS phishing attacks increased by 328% between 2020 and 2022, making it the fastest-growing cyber threat vector. The report emphasized the need for advanced detection mechanisms beyond traditional keyword filtering.

Chen et al. (2021) developed a machine learning-based SMS spam detection system using Support Vector Machines and achieved 89.7% accuracy. However, their system focused primarily on spam detection rather than sophisticated phishing attempts, which require more nuanced analysis.

### 2.1.3 Natural Language Processing in Security

The integration of natural language processing (NLP) in security applications has shown promising results. Wang and Li (2022) implemented a BERT-based model for detecting malicious text content, achieving 94.1% accuracy in identifying phishing attempts. Their work demonstrated the effectiveness of transformer-based models in understanding contextual information.

However, most existing NLP-based security solutions are computationally intensive and may not be suitable for real-time web applications. This limitation has led to the development of hybrid approaches that combine lightweight machine learning models with cloud-based AI services.

### 2.1.4 Web-Based Security Applications

The development of web-based security tools has gained momentum due to their accessibility and cross-platform compatibility. Rodriguez et al. (2021) created a web-based phishing detection system using JavaScript and achieved 87.3% accuracy. Their work demonstrated the feasibility of implementing machine learning algorithms in web browsers.

However, existing web-based solutions often lack the sophisticated analysis capabilities of desktop applications. The integration of cloud-based AI services has emerged as a solution to this limitation, as demonstrated by the work of Thompson and Garcia (2022).
