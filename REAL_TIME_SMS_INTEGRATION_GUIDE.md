// Broadcast Receiver
public class SMSReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        // Read SMS and send to web app
    }
}
```

**Method 2: Accessibility Service**
```java
// Accessibility Service
public class SMSService extends AccessibilityService {
    @Override
    public void onAccessibilityEvent(AccessibilityEvent event) {
        // Monitor SMS app for new messages
    }
}
```

### **iOS Integration**

**Method 1: Shortcuts App**
```javascript
// iOS Shortcuts automation
// Trigger: New SMS received
// Action: Send to web app via HTTP
```
